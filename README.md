# User-Login and Sign-Up Pages using react

This repository contains the **Login** and **Sign-Up** pages for the **Perfumey** website, built with **React**. These pages allow users to either log in to their account or sign up to create a new one. Both pages include form validation and responsive design.

## Features

### 1. **Login Page**
- **Username and Password Fields**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **Validation**: Basic validation ensures that both fields are not empty.
- **State Management**: Uses React `useState` to handle input fields and form submission.
- **Submit Action**: On successful login, the form can trigger a function to authenticate the user (e.g., making an API request).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures accessibility across devices.

### 2. **Sign-Up Page**
- **Username, Email, and Password Fields**: New users can enter their details (username, email, password, confirm password) to create an account.
- **Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled out correctly, including confirming the password.
- **State Management**: Uses React `useState` for managing form data and form submission.
- **Submit Action**: On form submission, the user details can be sent to an API for account creation.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive to ensure it works on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and handling the form submission.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form input and validation logic.
